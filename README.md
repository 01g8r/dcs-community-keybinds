# DCS Community Keybinds
A collection of keybinds for DCS. For use with Quaggles' DCS Input Command Injector:
https://github.com/Quaggles/dcs-input-command-injector

Using Quaggles' mod allows you to put custom keybinds in your _\<User\>\Saved Games\DCS_ folder, so you don't have to worry about redoing them when DCS updates are released.

In this repository are two folders. You'll only need one of them.

* __InputCommands__ has all the keybinds currently available for all modules in the project. Once you have Quaggles' mod going, put the InputCommands folder from this download in your _\<User\>\Saved Games\DCS_ folder.
  
* __InputCommands_Skeleton__ is a blank structure covering all modules for you to put your own keybinds in. Rename it to _InputCommands_ (remove the _Skeleton part) and place it in your _\<User\>\Saved Games\DCS_ folder.
  
__If you are interested in contributing...__ thank you. If you'd like to follow the patterns in place, that's great, if not, that's okay too. Right now the main objective is get better coverage.
