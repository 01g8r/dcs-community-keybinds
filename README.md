# DCS Community Keybinds
A collection of keybinds for DCS. For use with Quaggles' DCS Input Command Injector:
https://github.com/Quaggles/dcs-input-command-injector

Using Quaggles' mod allows you to put custom keybinds in your _\<User\>\Saved Games\DCS_ folder, so you don't have to worry about redoing them when DCS updates are released.

In this repository are two folders. You'll only need one of them.

* __InputCommands__ has all the keybinds currently available for all modules in the project. Once you have Quaggles' mod going, put the InputCommands folder from this download in your _\<User\>\Saved Games\DCS_ folder.
  
* __InputCommands_Skeleton__ is a blank structure covering all modules for you to put your own keybinds in. Rename it to _InputCommands_ (remove the _Skeleton part) and place it in your _\<User\>\Saved Games\DCS_ folder.
  
__If you are interested in contributing...__ thank you. If you'd like to follow the patterns in place, that's great, if not, that's okay too.

January 2023 Update: After a bit of a break from this project and DCS in general, I'm getting back to it. Next things up are working through issue reports (thank you), overdue updates for the Mirage F1, keybinds for MB-339, and keybinds for BS3.
